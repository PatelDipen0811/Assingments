<h1>Module (JAVASCRIPT BASIC & DOM) – 4</h1>
		
		<li><b>What is JavaScript?</b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b>JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.</p>
	
		
		<li><b>What is the use of isNaN function?</b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b>The JavaScript isNaN() Function is used to check whether a given value is an illegal number or not. It returns true if the value is a NaN else returns false. It is different from the Number. isNaN() Method.</p>
	
		<li><b>What is negative Infinity?</b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b>Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY is a special numeric value that is returned when an arithmetic operation or mathematical function generates a negative value greater than the largest representable number in JavaScript (i.e., more negative than -Number.MAX_VALUE).JavaScript displays the NEGATIVE_INFINITY value as -Infinity. This value behaves mathematically like infinity; for example, anything multiplied by infinity is infinity, and anything divided by infinity is zero. In ECMAScript v1 and later, you can also use -Infinity instead of Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY.
			<b>Syntax:Infinity, isFinite( )</b>
		</p>
	
		<li><b>Which company developed JavaScript? </b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b>JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995. It was developed for Netscape 2, and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997. After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript for the Firefox browser. Mozilla's latest version was 1.8.</p>
	
		<li><b>What are undeclared and undefined variables?</b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b>The difference between undefined and undeclared variables in JavaScript is:
			
				    <b>Undefined</b> variable means a variable has been declared but does not have a value.<br>
					<b>Undeclared</b> variable means that the variable does not exist in the program at all.
		
		</p>
	
		<li><b>Write the code for adding new elements dynamically? </b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b><br>
		<pre>
			Syntax:
				<b>document.createElement("&lt;tagName>");</b>
				Note:Where &lt;tagName> can be any HTML
				tagName like div, ul, button, etc.


				<b>let newDiv = document.createElement("div");</b> 
				Note:newDiv element has been created
		</pre>
	
		<li><b>What is the difference between ViewState and SessionState?</b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b>The basic difference between these two is that the ViewState is to manage state at the client’s end, making state management easy for end-user while SessionState manages state at the server’s end, making it easy to manage content from this end too.</p>
	
		<li><b>What is === operator?</b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b>The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be different.</p>
	
		<li><b>How can the style/class of an element be changed?</b></li>
		<p><b>Ans=></b>Through the DOM, you have access to a style object that describes the style of an element. This style object is defined as a CSSStyleDeclaration; you can see a detailed explanation of this at the W3C documentation of the CSSStyleDeclaration interface. The style object doesn’t quite work the same as some of the other properties defined in your HTML element. Unlike element.href or element.id, which return strings, element.style returns an object.
